RECORD 1, DAY 8

My name is Amnan Dhonchak and this is my 8th day attempting to signal out of the 3rd reality, AKA the NewLife. This is mainly because once you enter, it is unlikely that you exit, seriously! Only 1 person has escaped from here, and it hasn’t even been confirmed! 
If anyone can hear this, please respond. It seems as if people have been here for as long as for how long people have been on Earth. 
There is a whole civilization here who call themselves the NewLife Explorers. The NewLife Explorers are currently trying to invite people inside this place to help them find a way out of here. Many people here are also backrooms escapees, heh, seems they have experience.
I remember touching a floating tree that had a sign on it saying “TOUCH ME TO ESCAPE THIS MISERABLE PLACE!”. It was right, but it just led me to an even more miserable one. 
To be honest, I feel like this is an alternate backrooms, but more dangerous. Almost nowhere is safe. Instead of levels here, they are called Volumes and instead of entities, we call them VD (Volume dangers). 
Volume START is, of course, where you start. There are about no VDs here because of its properties. Its logic makes no sense, I mean, when did an infinite room make sense? Anyways, as you hear, it is infinite, and your sanity drains gradually in this Volume, mainly because you are alone. A tip for this area is to not freak out, the more you are freaked out you are, the more sanity you lose. 
Oh and did I mention that if you lose all your sanity, you just fall into Volume fate? Yeah, it’s pretty scary. 
To escape and to get to the first safe level you just have to basically walk until you see a brown attic plank above you, just open it and you get teleported. There is one other way, but it is more dangerous… You can try to run into walls until you go through it. Once you do, you go to what is known as Volume START?. Once you find this, you can continue further into the ? Volumes. Or, you could save yourself the pain and just do the same thing with the wall but do AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 
This is because you have a 5 second timer to run into the wall to your left. If you don’t, well, you are gonna have a BAD TIME. Volume START? Is Volume START but upside down and after the five seconds, all the walls disappear, meaning all the VDs will get pulled toward you and they WILL NOT hesitate to sacrifice you. Other ways to escape is to run enough to get teleported to Volume 2?. 
More on this Volume later. But once you do escape Volume START, you get to Volume 1. Volume 1 is a relatively safe place. There are a few groups who live here because this is the first safe Volume. You spawn in your house before you came to the NewLife, and if you were homeless, you would spawn in the last place you were sleeping at or your childhood home. You know it is fake, but you want to stay. Your childhood friends are good and well, and there are many more people. The stores are full of Shrimp Crackers, by the way, Shrimp Crackers help keep your sanity and even if you are allergic to them, nothing bad will happen to you, they also taste really good here! I have to go now, I will try to document this later. I also am planning on living here. Amnan Dhonchak signing off.


RECORD 2, DAY 13

Volume 1 was a trap level! We all escaped when we heard about it, but some people saved us. It tried to lure us in with our past and when we got too comfortable, they would release the VDs! We escaped by breaking a bag of Shrimp Crackers with our feet, leading us to Volume 2. On Volume 2, we know it isn’t safe because of books we read in Volume 1. Oh, and, if you’re wondering why I keep talking like I'm in a group, it’s because I found some people who I trust on Volume 1.
Together we decided we were going to be adventurers in the NewLife. The group: Bot Bran, Ranav Jain, Soubaway Stroni, Turkey Stroni, Robb Chans (Soubaway Stroni and Turkey Stroni are brothers). 
Volume 2 is like well, a death pile filled with VDs. It’s essentially a vent system with VDs lurking in certain paths. Luckily a few people wrote down some notes on the right paths. Thank god they did that. 
Anyways, the VDs here are called “The Sussers”. They range from a color scale of red to black and kind of look like giant beans. They can steal the identity of a victim, they pose as other humans and whistle very well. They will try to fit in with your group and are very dangerous. The only ways to tell the difference is if you know the person very well and this is one of the only VDs that don’t instantly kill you. 
Going back to the Volume fate thing, it is basically infinite pain. It puts you up to all of your biggest fears and it won’t even kill you, but they WILL harm you. 
To escape from here, you have to face your fear and defeat it in some way, take it the biggest roller coaster on earth, you have to ride it without being scared, if you are, it will continue to put you in different roller coasters that are also extremely scary for people who are scared of them. Once you do pass, you get sent back to where you entered. 
Also, the Sussers will make very faint sounds when they steal an identity, I can’t make it out but it sounds something like “AMOGUS”. They also have slightly redder eyes. Ok, I gotta go now. My group’s waiting for me. I’ll make a new record when I get to Volume 3. Amnan Dhonchak signing off.






RECORD 3, DAY 15
The vents appeared to be longer than I expected. It took 2 whole days to get out. Well, I might as well talk about Volume 3 While I’m at it. Volume 3 is relatively safe for the most part, but if you go too deep it starts getting dangerous. I’ve seen other adventurers here asking some of the settlers about information. I should ask one, too, I mean, I have no idea what could happen in this Volume.
Anyways, I’m gonna talk about Volume 2? now. Volume 2? is a larger IKEA that starts devouring you after staying there for 1 hour. 
	It devours you by calling all of its employees to become cannibals. These employees were former humans before being eaten and/or infected by the “work virus”. So basically, you earn the work virus by eating the food there. To escape, you can find a brown chair that has a mark saying 3? or a yellow chair saying START?. 
	Touching either of these chairs will lead you to the levels marked on them. 
	Volume 3 looks like a regular city surrounded by a forest. As stated earlier, its safe in the middle but the further out you go, the more dangerous it gets. The settlers here split the areas here into four sectors. 
Sector 1: the safest sector. Most settlers live in this sector. There are no VDs in this area because of a force field that protects the settlers. Can exit from here to Volume 4 by going into an open house.
Sector 2: the second safest sector. Some settlers live here because it is less crowded and it’s still relatively safe. The reason why I say this is because of its properties. It sometimes randomly teleports you if you aren’t careful or it might teleport VDs to you if you harm the sector, such as sticking sticks into the ground.
Sector 3: The first dangerous sector: it has some common VDs scattered around, not many people are here. There are a few notes, but otherwise, its filled with trees and VDs
Sector 4: the most dangerous sector: Not much is known about this sector because, why would anyone want to come here? But from what we were told, it was a pitch black area infested with VDs.
The group’s thinking of resting here for a bit, then getting back on track. Maybe picking up some information on the next few Volumes while resting. I’m gonna go to sleep now. It’s been a long day. Amnan Dhonchak signing off.



Record 4, Day 18

Hey! We’re back again, documenting the NewLife lifestyle! Hey! Bot Bran what are you doing? 
Bot Bran stealing the camera and microphone from Amnan. 
Bot: Don’t mind him, he is acting a little weird, trying to sound enthusiastic to lift up the mood of being here. Here Amnan, take the camera back. 
Amnan takes the camera and microphone back. 
Amnan: Anyways… we’re now taking off for Volume 4 which is sadly, also very dangerous. It’s an open house that tries to lure you in. 
	Inside the house though is many VDs and broken tiles of glass above, just waiting to fall on you. Yes, WAITING. You have to go through the house eventually though because it’s the only way to exit. 
	You have to dodge all the glass tiles above you and the VDs that will chase you to the exit. There is another weird property here that makes us all go one by one. So we can’t help each other, which is sad. 
The group gets to Volume 4.
Okay team! Here we are!
Bot: This looks like my neighbors house!
Ranav: Where are the glass tiles?
Soub: It looks bigger on the inside!
Turkey: Woah! This looks epic!
Robbs: So this is how it looks like!
Amnan: Soooo how is it going to decide who goes first? Do we just pick?
Soub: I guess so..
Robbs: I’m going first!
Turkey: I’m going last!
They all decide the order they go in and speedily run to the other side and wait for the others.
Turkey: Finally! It’s my turn! Now we can go! Turkey starts running as fast as he can.
Turkey: I’m almost there!
The Gang: Come on Turkey! You can do it!
But at the last step, Turkey tripped and his leg got stuck in the flooring.
Soub: TURKEY! GRAB MY HAND NOW! Turkey reaches out and Soub pulls, The Gang helps too, After some struggling, they manage to pull Turkey out of the hole before the VDs arrive.
Turkey: THANK YOU GUYS!
Soub: No problem. Just saving you from danger.
The Gang starts cheering while going to the exit.
Amnan: Wow! That sure was a ride of emotions! Luckily we all made it out safely, thanks to Soub. I guess we are here now gang.. Volume 5.
The First Test. This is it, to see if we are capable enough to survive here. 
Greeter: Welcome to Volume 5 A.K.A, the First Test. Here you will find if you are capable enough to survive and become true Adventurers. You will get your gear and then we will escort you to the battlefield, where you will be put against VDs to see if you can fight them. We first will do team tests, then continue to the solo battles. Good luck, you’ll need it.
LOG ENDS



Record 5, Day 20
Today is the day when we finally get tested. They let us rest and eat delicious food before actually fighting. The VDs we fought on the battlefield were simple, since we’re new to the NewLife Adventurers, they only put Sussers. 
I hope we’ll get better training once we’re more experienced. That would help us a lot in escaping this place, if we even can. 
I heard that they use the employees from one of those question mark Volumes, was it 2? either way, it’ll likely be difficult for us. 
I’ll record more once we do groups. Haha, just kidding. 
I’m not gonna end it this quickly. Anyways, they said our group was too small so they grouped us up with some guy named Gray. 
I don’t know why but being with him made me feel like I was having a hard time breathing because of the cringe. It enraged the Sussers so much they turned into giant The Beings From Above and smashed Gray to the ground, instantly killing him. 
But the power was too big for the Sussers to handle and they exploded into a big mess. Looking at Gray perish though made me feel better and I felt a sigh of relief. I think the Council of the Adventurers felt the same. As they looked, more pleasant after his death.
After completing the team test, we now had to move onto the solo tests.
We got different gear because the ones we were using before were team gear. Pretty nifty, huh? Anyways, since we’re going solo, the armor is stronger than team gear.  Anyways, I gotta go fight these Sussers. They won’t wait for me to finish my audio recording before brutally ripping me into pieces, at least I think? I’m not ending the recording yet.
Sounds of Amnan and Sussers clashing, ending with Amnan and distant voices cheering
Woohoo, I won! I guess I should go to sleep now. Amnan signing off.


Record 6, Day 25
Hi guys, Turkey Stroni here! Anyway, Anman gave me the cam and mic because he and some of the others got injured battling some pretty strong VD’S. Luckily, Ranav ,Robb, and my bro saved Bot (Robb does a mean elbow to the stomach). 
Amnan’s taking care of Bot but he’s arguing with Soubaway Stroni about who should take the first shift. OH CRAP, BRAN JUST SENT MY BRO TO BRAZIL! HOLD ON I”M COMING MAN! Drops mic and run towards the fight. Sounds of battle and bloody crap flying everywhere. Alright I’m back guys! That was freaking INTENSE! Anyways, if anyone outside can hear me please send help!
 I don’t think we can survive any longer in this place, the groups started sending death threats! Luckily I”M ALWAYS there to help! Bot Bran slaps mic out of Tukey Stronis hand. Bot : That’s not true! Just last week you started punching me for no reason! Turkey Stroni takes the mic back. YOU IDIOT! YOU NEED TO STOP DOING THAT! 
Anyways, I forgot to say something! Along with the new gear Anman got a special helmet that lets him record during battle! All adventures please report to the battlefield! Just in time! Guys, hurry up! Were going to battle! Oh yeah! There’s a new member in the group! I think his name was Anthony something? Anyway, that’s not important, what is that the gear we got is sick! I mean, look at the size of this rifle! Oh, I almost forgot! The battle is starting! Alright, your about to get a close up of a NewLife battle!



Battle 1, Day 25
I’m gonna choose a whip for battle, and some light armor. Alright, what do we have here? Sussers again? This is boring! Alright big one coming at me, I’m just going to say my attacks so you guys can keep up with me. Right 










Preview for next records:
